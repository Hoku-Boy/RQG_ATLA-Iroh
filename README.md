# Random Quote Generator
Random quotes generated from one of Avatar's wisest: Uncle Iroh! This static website generates one quote at a time, at random, from a list of Uncle Iroh's best and most memorable quotes. Uncle, or should I say General, Iroh is the brother of Fire Lord Ozai and thus the uncle to then Fire Prince Zuko. His life experiences and mentorship to Zuko alone makes him a fan favorite of those fond of Avatar: The Last Airbender.

# Setup
To get started at creating your own 'Random Quote Generator', simply fork the repo. Then, replace the contents of the quotes array in scripts.js with quotes of your own. Be sure to update the site title as well as asset images to complement your characters' theme.

# Usage
When you first visit the site, a quote is already shown at random to the visitor. To generate another quote, press the shuffle icon. If a quote tugs at your heartstrings, you can hit the share icon to spread the word on twitter. Be aware of twitter's character limitations as quotes over a certain length will raise errors when attempting to tweet.

# Future Iterations
Here are some of the things I'm hoping to include in future updates to the site:

1. Moving the quotes array to a json file hosted on Dropbox.
2. Add meta tags for tumblr, twitter, linkedin, pinterest, etc.
3. Add share buttons for tumblr, facebook, linkedin, pinterest.
4. ~Add footer tag that includes copyright information.~
5. Each random quote will play its corresponding audio clip.
